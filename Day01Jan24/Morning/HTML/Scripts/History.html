                    <b>Prehistory</b><br><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp Fossil evidence indicates the olive tree had its origins 20–40 million years ago in the Oligocene, 
                    in what is now corresponding to Italy and the eastern Mediterranean Basin. Wild oleasters were 
                    present and collected in the East Mediterranean since ~19,000 BP. The genome of cultivated olives 
                    reflects their origin from oleaster populations in the East Mediterranean. The olive plant was 
                    first cultivated some 7,000 years ago in Mediterranean regions.<br><br>
                    
                    &nbsp &nbsp The edible olive seems to have coexisted with humans for about 5,000 to 6,000 years, going back 
                    to the early Bronze Age (3150 to 1200 BC). Its origin can be traced to the Levant based on 
                    written tablets, olive pits, and wood fragments found in ancient tombs.<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp The immediate ancestry of the cultivated olive is unknown. Fossil Olea pollen has been found in 
                    Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus is an original 
                    element of the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of Olea were found in the palaeosols of 
                    the volcanic Greek island of Santorini (Thera) and were dated about 37,000 BP. Imprints of 
                    larvae of olive whitefly Aleurolobus (Aleurodes) olivinus were found on the leaves. The same 
                    insect is commonly found today on olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary 
                    relations have not changed since that time. Other leaves found on the same island are dated back 
                    to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest known olives from the Mediterranean.<br><br>
                    
                    &nbsp &nbsp As far back as 3000 BC, olives were grown commercially in Crete; they may have been the source 
                    of the wealth of the Minoan civilization.<br><br><br>

                    <b>Outside the Mediterranean</b><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp Olives are not native to the Americas. Spanish colonists brought the olive to the New World, 
                    where its cultivation prospered in present-day Peru, Chile, and Argentina. The first seedlings 
                    from Spain were planted in Lima by Antonio de Rivera in 1560. Olive tree cultivation quickly 
                    spread along the valleys of South America's dry Pacific coast where the climate was similar to 
                    the Mediterranean. Spanish missionaries established the tree in the 18th century in California. 
                    It was first cultivated at Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769 or later around 1795. Orchards 
                    were started at other missions, but in 1838, an inspection found only two olive orchards in 
                    California. Cultivation for oil gradually became a highly successful commercial venture from the 
                    1860s onward. In Japan, the first successful planting of olive trees happened in 1908 on Shodo 
                    Island, which became the cradle of olive cultivation in Japan. An estimated 865 million olive 
                    trees were in the world as of 2005, and the vast majority of these were found in Mediterranean 
                    countries, with traditionally marginal areas accounting for no more than 25% of olive-planted 
                    area and 10% of oil production.<br><br>
