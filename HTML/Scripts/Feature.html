                    <b>LONGEVITY</b> : Olive trees can live for thousands of years. There are many trees in the 
                    Mediterranean region that are scientifically verified to be as old as 2,000 years.<br><br>

                    <b>PROLIFIC</b> : The olive tree starts bearing fruit at around 5 years of age. A tree in 
                    Croatia that is radiocarbon-dated to be 1,600 years old still produces abundant fruit today.<br><br>

                    <b>INDESTRUCTIBLE</b> : The root system of the olive tree is so robust that it’s capable of 
                    regenerating itself even when the above-ground structure of the tree is destroyed by frost, 
                    fire or disease. In Tuscany in 1985 a severe frost destroyed many productive and aged olive trees, 
                    ruining the livelihoods of many farmers. However when new shoots appeared in the spring and the dead 
                    wood was removed, they soon became new fruit-producing trees.<br><br>

                    <b>UNPARCHABLE</b> : Olive trees are drought friendly’ and just like eucalyptus trees do not need 
                    to be watered.<br><br>

                    <b>GENEROUS</b> : Large olive trees produce on average about 400 pounds of olives annually. 
                    Older and larger trees can produce more. It’s estimated that there are about 865 million olive 
                    trees in the world today.<br><br>

                    <b>ANCIENT</b> : The edible olive has been cultivated for at least 6,000 years. Lore has it that 
                    olives fell from trees into salt water on the banks of the Mediterranean where they and were 
                    discovered and eaten.<br><br>

                    <b>SACRED</b> : Olive oil has long been considered sacred. The olive branch was often a symbol of 
                    abundance, glory and peace. The leafy branches of the olive tree were ritually offered to deities 
                    and powerful figures as emblems of benediction and purification, and they were used to crown the 
                    victors of both games and wars. Olive oil is still used today in many religious ceremonies. 
                    Over history, the olive has been the symbol of peace, wisdom, glory, fertility, power and purity.<br><br>

                    <b>HEALTHY</b> : Olives are incredibly healthy fruit (yes, fruit—they are a distant cousin of 
                    the peach) containing antioxidants, healthy fats and fiber.<br><br>
