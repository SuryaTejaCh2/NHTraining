                    &nbsp &nbsp The <b>olive</b>, botanical name <b>Olea europaea</b>, meaning 'European olive', is a species 
                    of small tree or shrub in the family Oleaceae, found traditionally in the Mediterranean Basin. 
                    The species is cultivated in all the countries of the Mediterranean, as well as in Australia, 
                    New Zealand, North and South America and South Africa. Olea europaea is the type species for 
                    the genus Olea.<br><br>
                    
                    &nbsp &nbspThe olive's fruit, also called an "olive", is of major agricultural importance in the 
                    Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil; it is one of the core ingredients in 
                    Mediterranean cuisine. The tree and its fruit give their name to the plant family, which also 
                    includes species such as lilacs, jasmine, Forsythia, and the true ash trees (Fraxinus).<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp The word olive derives from Latin ŏlīva ("olive fruit", "olive tree"), possibly through 
                    Etruscan 𐌀𐌅𐌉𐌄𐌋𐌄 (eleiva) from the archaic Proto-Greek form *ἐλαίϝα (*elaíwa) 
                    (Classic Greek ἐλαία elaía, "olive fruit", "olive tree").<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp The word oil originally meant "olive oil", from ŏlĕum, ἔλαιον (élaion, "olive oil"). 
                    Also in multiple other languages the word for "oil" ultimately derives from the name of this 
                    tree and its fruit.<br><br>
