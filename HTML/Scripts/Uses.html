                    &nbsp &nbsp The <b>Olive</b> tree, Olea europaea, has been cultivated for olive oil, fine wood, 
                    olive leaf, ornamental reasons, and the olive fruit. About 90% of all harvested olives are turned 
                    into oil, while about 10% are used as table olives. The olive is one of the "trinity" or "triad" 
                    of basic ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat for bread, pasta, and 
                    couscous, and the grape for wine.<br><br>

                    <b>Table olives:</b> are classified by the IOC into three groups according to the degree of ripeness 
                    achieved before harvesting:<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Green olives</b> are picked when they have obtained full size, while unripe; they are usually 
                    shades of green to yellow, and contain the bitter phytochemical, oleuropein.<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Semi-ripe or turning-colour olives</b> are picked at the beginning of the ripening cycle, when 
                    the colour has begun to change from green to multicolour shades of red to brown. Only the skin is 
                    coloured, as the flesh of the fruit lacks pigmentation at this stage, unlike that of ripe olives.<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Black olives or ripe olives</b> are picked at full maturity when fully ripe, 
                    displaying colours of purple, brown or black. To leach the oleuropein from olives, commercial 
                    producers use lye, which neutralizes the bitterness of oleuropein, producing a mild flavour and 
                    soft texture characteristic of California black olives sold in cans. Such olives are typically 
                    preserved in brine and sterilized under high heat during the canning process.<br><br><br>


                    &nbsp <b>Traditional fermentation and curing</b><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp Raw or fresh olives are naturally very bitter; to make them palatable, olives must be 
                    cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter phenolic compound that can reach levels 
                    of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to oleuropein, other phenolic compounds render 
                    freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing 
                    and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak in young fruit and are converted 
                    as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their 
                    conversion to other organic products which render some cultivars edible immediately.[89] One example 
                    of an edible olive native to the island of Thasos is the throubes black olive, which when allowed to 
                    ripen in the sun, shrivel, and fall from the tree, is then edible.<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp The curing process may take from a few days, with lye, to a few months with brine or 
                    salt packing. With the exception of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing 
                    involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final 
                    table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce 
                    fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other 
                    unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, 
                    such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the 
                    final table olives.[89] Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. 
                    Lactic acid is the most important metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative 
                    against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored 
                    without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most 
                    suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of 
                    metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid 
                    in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.<br><br>
